COVID-19 in Virginia and the US
I got interested first in tracking cases in my own state of Virginia, based on the data the Virginia Department of Health 
publishes daily. 

New York State is about a third of COVID-19 cases total, so I was interested in what the total US case count looked like 
without New York cases. That uses the Johns Hopkins data that populates their map.
